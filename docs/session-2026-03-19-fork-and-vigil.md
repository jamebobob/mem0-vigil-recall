## What's NOT Done Yet

### Deploy to gateway
The fork is built and pushed but not deployed. See `openclaw/DEPLOY.md`
for the procedure. Requires SSH access to gateway.

### LCM install and testing (Vigil Track B)
LCM plugin not installed. Q4-5 testing (postCompactionSections, summary
markers) not done. The capture filter is ready and will activate once
LCM is deployed, but LCM itself is OpenClaw-side work.

### Family pool is_private audit (Vigil A2 prerequisite)
Must run before enabling the recall guard in production. Batch-migrated
memories may carry incorrect `is_private: true` tags. See Vigil v5
"Day 3 pre-deploy step" for the Qdrant query.

### Gateway SSH key setup for Claude Code
No SSH access to gateway from this machine. Deploy requires either:
- SSH key exchange, or
- Running the deploy steps manually on gateway, or
- A future Claude Code session with gateway access

### Telemetry data collection
A5 (significance-weighted recall) and A6 (never-recalled cleanup) both
require 2-4 weeks of telemetry data before they can be designed or run.
The telemetry module is recording data from the moment it's deployed.

### Cron audit (Vigil Day 6)
Review of cron job behavior, first telemetry data review, and LCM
compaction cycle quality check if LCM is enabled.

### Test suites from PRs #4409-4412
The Vigil v5 plan mentions porting test suites from the upstream PRs.
Not done. The 6 SDK patches have no dedicated unit tests beyond the
existing fork-level test suite.

## Patch Count Reconciliation

Vigil v5 references "12 existing patches." During fork setup, 2 of the
12 were found to be already fixed in the current upstream HEAD:
- Ollama embedder fix (PR #4176 — merged upstream)
- OSS threshold normalization (PR #4224 — merged upstream)

This reduced 12 patches to 10 that needed applying. Of those 10:
- 6 are core SDK patches (commits c21dd88b through d95a6939)
- 4 are multi-pool plugin patches (commits 575fc2a4 through e26fa3be)

The guard try/catch fix (afad44ed) was found during audit and is a
bugfix on top of the Vigil recall guard wiring, not one of the
original 10 patches.
